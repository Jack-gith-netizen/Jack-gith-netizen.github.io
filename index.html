                    <p>Welcome everyone. Before we begin, please check Slack for the starter code. Open the files on your
                        computer and give us a heads-up once you’re ready. This code will be our foundation as we go
                        through the demos later.</p>

                    <p>In this slide, we compare CSS and JavaScript animations. CSS animations are great for simple,
                        straightforward effects—they’re easy to implement and maintain. In contrast, JavaScript
                        animations offer greater control and flexibility, which is useful for more complex or dynamic
                        scenarios. Later, I’ll show you an example that highlights these differences in action.</p>

                    <h3>3. Basic Animation Properties</h3>
                    <p>Let’s start with the basic properties of CSS animations. The 'animation-name' property links an
                        element to a set of @keyframes that define the animation sequence. Meanwhile, 'animation-duration'
                        specifies how long one cycle of the animation takes to complete. These two properties form the
                        core of any CSS animation.</p>

                    <h3>4. Repetition & Direction</h3>
                    <p>Now, we’ll discuss how to control the repetition and direction of animations.
                        'Animation-iteration-count' lets you set how many times an animation should play—this can be a
                        specific number or infinite. 'Animation-direction' determines whether the animation plays
                        normally, in reverse, or alternates between the two. Finally, 'animation-fill-mode' controls the
                        state of the element before and after the animation runs, ensuring a smooth visual transition.

                    <h3>5. Timing Properties</h3>
                    <p>Next are the timing properties. 'Animation-delay' sets a pause before the animation starts, and
                        interestingly, it can even be negative, so the animation begins partway through its cycle.
                        'Animation-timing-function' lets you define the speed curve of the animation, like easing in or
                        out, which affects how the animation feels. 'Animation-play-state' is useful for pausing and
                        resuming the animation as needed. Understanding these gives you fine control over how and when
                        your animations play.</p>

                    <h3>6. The 'animation' Shorthand</h3>
                    <p>This slide introduces the 'animation' shorthand property. Instead of writing out each individual
                        property, you can bundle them into a single line. This not only simplifies your CSS but also
                        makes it easier to maintain. For those who want more detail, I’ve included a link to the MDN
                        documentation on CSS animations.</p>

                    <h3>7. Accessibility Considerations</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design. With animations, it’s important to consider users
                        who may experience discomfort from excessive motion. Best practices include providing a ‘reduce
                        motion’ option and ensuring that animations are subtle and not too distracting. This approach
                        helps make your website more inclusive and user-friendly.</p>

                    <p>Finally, let’s look at some real-world examples of CSS animations. On this slide, you’ll see
                        screenshots and brief notes on how popular websites implement CSS animations to enhance user
                        experience. Take note of how these sites balance motion with usability—this can provide great
                        inspiration for your own projects. In our demo, we’ll also inspect some live examples to see these
                        techniques in action.</p>
