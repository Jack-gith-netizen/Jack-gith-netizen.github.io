                <h2>1. Starter Code</h2>
                <p>Welcome everyone. Before we begin, please check Slack for the starter code. Open the files on your
                    computer and give us a heads-up once you’re ready. This code will be our foundation as we go
                    through the demos later.</p>

                <h2>2. CSS vs. JavaScript Animations</h2>
                <p>In this slide, we compare CSS and JavaScript animations. CSS animations are great for simple,
                    straightforward effects—they’re easy to implement and maintain. In contrast, JavaScript
                    animations offer greater control and flexibility, which is useful for more complex or dynamic
                    scenarios. Later, I’ll show you an example that highlights these differences in action.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Basic Animation Properties</h2>
                <p>Let’s start with the basic properties of CSS animations. The 'animation-name' property links an
                    element to a set of @keyframes that define the animation sequence. Meanwhile, 'animation-duration'
                    specifies how long one cycle of the animation takes to complete. These two properties form the
                    core of any CSS animation.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Repetition & Direction</h2>
                <p>Now, we’ll discuss how to control the repetition and direction of animations.
                    'Animation-iteration-count' lets you set how many times an animation should play—this can be a
                    specific number or infinite. 'Animation-direction' determines whether the animation plays
                    normally, in reverse, or alternates between the two. Finally, 'animation-fill-mode' controls the
                    state of the element before and after the animation runs, ensuring a smooth visual transition.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Timing Properties</h2>
                <p>Next are the timing properties. 'Animation-delay' sets a pause before the animation starts, and
                    interestingly, it can even be negative, so the animation begins partway through its cycle.
                    'Animation-timing-function' lets you define the speed curve of the animation, like easing in or
                    out, which affects how the animation feels. 'Animation-play-state' is useful for pausing and
                    resuming the animation as needed. Understanding these gives you fine control over how and when
                    your animations play.</p>

                <h2>6. The 'animation' Shorthand</h2>
                <p>This slide introduces the 'animation' shorthand property. Instead of writing out each individual
                    property, you can bundle them into a single line. This not only simplifies your CSS but also
                    makes it easier to maintain. For those who want more detail, I’ve included a link to the MDN
                    documentation on CSS animations.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>7. Accessibility Considerations</h2>
                <p>Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design. With animations, it’s important to consider users
                    who may experience discomfort from excessive motion. Best practices include providing a ‘reduce
                    motion’ option and ensuring that animations are subtle and not too distracting. This approach
                    helps make your website more inclusive and user-friendly.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>8. Real-World Examples</h2>
                <p>Finally, let’s look at some real-world examples of CSS animations. On this slide, you’ll see
                    screenshots and brief notes on how popular websites implement CSS animations to enhance user
                    experience. Take note of how these sites balance motion with usability—this can provide great
                    inspiration for your own projects. In our demo, we’ll also inspect some live examples to see these
                    techniques in action.</p>

                <h2>Hint</h2>
                <p>As we do not provide a dedicated 'Back to Home' button on the Angular demo pages, please use 
                    your browser's back button to navigate back when you enter these pages.</p>
